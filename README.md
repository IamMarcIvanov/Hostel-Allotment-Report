# Hostel-Allotment-Report
This will contain all the versions of the report that I have to submit by 22 Noon July 2020

Build a mobile application for the Hostel Allotment problem:
1. Problem overview
2. User stories (for the student app)
3. Mindmap 
4. UI design (wire frames showing the sequence of steps)
5. Suggests for implementation

Currently Hostel Allotment Report only contains the Problem Overview
While the images folder contains all the wireframes
